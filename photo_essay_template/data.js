Starting in May, construction workers and bulldozers will flow into the gardens. Under the supervision of the French state, together with private developers and local authorities, they will start building an olympic pool with 4000 square meters of wellness facilities - comprising a solarium, a fitness studio and saunas - to be located on parts of the gardens. And local gardeners are not happy: they created the <i>Aubervilliers Gardens’ Defense Collective</i> (<i>Collectif de défense des Jardins d’Aubervilliers</i>) to protest against the project.</p>"

Around 5 plots of the gardens are up for grabs every year, as veteran gardeners decide to leave. Meanwhile, the association managing the gardens receives between 50 and 100 applications from newcomers yearly - who have to go through a selection process including a letter of motivation and an interview to be granted a plot. The lucky few are then expected to cultivate the land, and not simply use their shed for a weekly barbecue - these are, after all, workmen’s gardens.</p>"

She has a special name for “them” - which includes everyone associated with the project: the development company <i>Grand Paris Aménagement</i>, politicians who gave the green light, and so on. Dolores calls them “concreters” (<i>bétonneurs</i> in French, a made-up word for concrete makers). And she has a lot to say about them. <p>“One hectare, here, it’s really valuable. If we’re fighting here, it’s so they don’t concrete the land.” She explains: “What makes the charm of the gardens, to me, is really the contrast between their urban side and the impression that you’re in the countryside. <em>Here, it doesn’t feel like Paris - it’s both out of time, and out of Paris.</em>”</p><p> Just the idea of building a solarium, whose tickets would cost 16€ according to early estimates - way beyond the means of local residents, who live in one of the poorest cities in the Paris area - is, to her, revolting: “There’s an indecent side to it. Contemptuous, even. They’re saying “we’re going to pacify”; they don’t say gentrify anymore, but <i>pacify</i>, because apparently it’s too violent here.” The ultimate irony being that, according to the <i>Collective</i>, the solarium could be built on the pool’s roof, which would preserve the gardens.</p><p> Her view on the Paris Olympics, then, should not come as a surprise. “I think these Olympics are a farce - these Olympics which are supposedly eco-friendly. First, they’re the <i>Paris</i> 2024 Olympics. But it’s here that they’re coming to concrete.” Never running out of ideas, she even renamed them <em>“the Olympics of shame.”</em></p><p> As the commencement of work gets closer, she gets even more resolved. Her slogan: <em>“resisting against concrete. Saving the land, saving it from concrete - that’s what matters the most.”</em></p>"
